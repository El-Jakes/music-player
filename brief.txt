Project Brief

The goal is to build a very simple music player
1. The app must have a very simple UI, no need to have a lot of styling as the goal is to understand the purpose of javascript in the app not CSS

2. Pressing the 'spacebar' key on your keyboard must either Pause or Play the music

3. Pressing the Letter 'N' must play the next song

4. Pressing the Letter "P" must play the previous song

5.Pressing the letter 'S' must stop the song entirely (This is different from pause as playing the song again will start it from beginning)

Note: You can use any 5 songs of your choice to build this app.
